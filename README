KeyboarHelper adds a inputAccessoryView with Previsou, Next and Done button.

If any textfield or textarea is selected a toolbar with the above buttons 
will be shown just above the keyboard.

Previous button is absent if the first textfield/view is selected and Next button is absent
if the last textfield/view is selected.

A callback to the done button can be assigned as selector or block.

KeyboardHelper works with a ViewController object.
Example:

Step 1: Declare a property
...
#import "KeyboardHelper.h"
...
...
@property (nonatomic, strong) KeyboardHelper* kbHelper;

Step 2: Initialize in viewDidLoad method
// in viewDidLoad method:
// using selector
self.kbHelper = [[KeyboardHelper alloc] initWithViewController:self onDoneSelector:@selector(onDone)];

// using block
self.kbHelper = [[KeyboardHelper alloc] initWithViewController:self onDoneAction:^(void){
		NSLog(@"On Done!!");
	}];
	
NOTE: If view is not loaded, there will be an exception

Step 3: Enable/Disable
Since KeyboardHelper observs UIKeyboardWillShowNotification and UIKeyboardWillHideNotification,
it needs to be remove itself from observing before the view disappears.

- (void) viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated{
	[self.kbHelper enable];
}
- (void) viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated{
	[self.kbHelper disable];
}


Step 4: Delegates
KeyboardHelper sets itself as delegate to all the UITextField and UITextView present 
in the viewcontroller it initialized with.

So, it exposes these two properities allowing any external delegate:

1. textViewDelegate
2. textFieldDelegate


Known Issues:
1. Doesn't work well in Landscape mode.
2. Landscape right orientation is not supported.
